# Introduction

## Purpose

The main purpose of this document is the correct and complete requirement and design specification for the Tiber App for its future implementation, as well as the description of the testing plan to verify its correct functioning.

The Tiber App is designed as a companion app for the Tiber Club Scuola di Calcio, a Rome-based soccer school and family association. Its main purpose is informing children and parents about the different activities organized by the association, as well as providing a leaderboard for children to compete, based on their performance in the soccer matches played by the club.

## Goals of the project

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[PG-01]** | Provide an easy to use and informative channel to inform parents and children of the activities organized in Tiber Club |
| **[PG-02]** | Provide a leaderboard in which children participating in the soccer school can compete based on their performance       |
| **[PG-03]** | Provide a easy way of sharing the activities organized with people that might be interested in participating            |
| **[PG-04]** | Send timely and relevant notifications to inform of the activities organized in Tiber Club                              |

## Scope

The scope of the Tiber App project encompasses the specification, development, implementation and testing of a mobile app tailored for the Tiber Club Scuola di Calcio to accomplish the goals described in the previous section.

To this end, the project's core functionalities will include extensive user management and fine-grained permissions, an event system to manage activities, a leaderboard system and integration with APIs services for location and weather information.

## Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations

- *Scuola di Calcio*: Italian for "Soccer School"
- *API*: Application Programming Interface, a set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.

# Overall description

This section contains a high-level description of the application, based on the needs of the stakeholders. It describes the application as a series of scenarios that capture the functionality the users expect of the app, captures the functions the application will need to perform, analyzes the different types of users of the application and lists the assumptions, dependencies and constraints that need to be respected by the system.
